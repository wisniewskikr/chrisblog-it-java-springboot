Request:
- type: type of authorization

- state

Steps:
1. User via browser sends request to Application with action
1. Application sends back response to browser with information above
1. Browser sends request to Authentication Servier for form with information above
1. Authentication Servier sends back to User via browser form
1. User via browser fills credentials
1. User via broser sends form to Authorization Server
1. Authorization Server sends back response to browser with code and state
1. Browser sends request to Application with code and state
1. Application sends request to Authentication Server with code and state for token
1. Authentication Server sends back response to Application the token
1. Application sends request to Data Base for user info
1. Data Base sends back response to Application with user info
1. Aplication sends back response to User via browser with user info

Security:
	- Client Authentication + Client Authorization
		- SSO
			- SAML
			- OIDC + OAuth2
		- NO-SSO
			- OAuth2
				- Token inside Client
					- Hardcoded
					- Autogenerated
				- Token outside Client			
					- Authentication
					- Outsourced Authentication - OIDC
			- No-OAuth2
	- Server Authentication - SSL
	- Client Authorization - OAuth2
		- JWT (JSON Web Token) (Header + Payload + Signature)
		- etc.
