DESCRIPTION
-----------

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to present how to implement **communication** between two applications using **WebClient** type **mono**. The result is **Hello World** message and **port** numbers of **Text** and **Display** services in a **JSON** format in a **browser** using **Java** applications with **Spring Boot** framework.

##### Details
Three the most important ways of communication between applications in Spring Boot are:
* **RestTemplate**: synchronous communication
* **WebClient**: synchronous and asynchronous communication
* **OpenFeing**: related to Spring Cloud

WebClient handles two types of responses:
* **mono**: single class is returned;
* **flux**: collection of classes is returned.

WebClient can be also:
* **not blocked**: asynchronous communication. Code execution is not blocked by WebClient - execution doesn't wait for finishing WebClient task;
* **blocked**: synchronous communication. Code execution is blocked by WebClient - execution waits for finishing WebClient task.
 
In this example - WebClient type "mono" - single class is returned from Text service. The application displays message "Hello World" and "port" numbers of "Text" and "Display" services in JSON format in a browser. Service "Text" provides text which should be displayed. Service "Display" connects with service "Text" and takes from it text and port and then display it in a browser.
