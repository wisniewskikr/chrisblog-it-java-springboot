DESCRIPTION
-----------

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to present how to use **Keycloak** to **secure** routing type **Gateway API** with usage **Java** programming language and **Spring Cloud** framework. Gateway API enables routing - mapping - from one route to another. In this way all microservices can have one URL. It this example Gateway API is **configured the config class**, not in application.properties file. 

This chain of services consists of following applications:
* **Service**: java REST API application which displays "Hello World!" text
* **Gateway**: a tool which routes from one URL to other URL

##### Terminology
Terminology explanation:
* **Git**: tool for distributed version control
* **Maven**: tool for build automation
* **Java**: object-oriented programming language
* **Spring Boot**: framework for Java. It consists of: Spring + Container + Configuration
* **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway is a reactive, API gateway service in the Spring Cloud ecosystem. It provides routing, load balancing, and API request handling. Built on top of Spring WebFlux, it allows dynamic routing, filtering, and monitoring of requests to various microservices, acting as a reverse proxy with features like path rewriting, rate limiting, and security integration.
**Keycloak**: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides features like single sign-on (SSO), user federation, identity brokering, and role-based access control (RBAC). It allows secure authentication and authorization for web apps and services with minimal setup.


USAGES
------

This project can be tested in following configurations:
* **Usage Docker Compose**: all services are started as Docker containers definied in docker compose file.
* **Usage Kubernetes (Kind)**: all services are started as Kubernetes pods.


USAGE DOCKER COMPOSE
--------------------

> **Usage Docker Compse** means that microservices and Database are provided as **Docker containers** definied in **Docker Compose** file. 

> Please **clone/download** project, open **project's main folder** in your favorite **command line tool** and then **proceed with steps below**.

> Please be aware that following tools should be installed on your local PC:  
* **Operating System** (tested on Windows 11)
* **Git** (tested on version 2.33.0.windows.2)
* **Docker** (tested on version 4.33.1)

##### Required steps:
1. Update **hosts** file (Run as Administrator; Windows: "Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"; MAC/Linux: "etc/hosts") with new line **127.0.0.1 keycloak**
1. Start **Docker** tool
1. In a command line tool **start Docker containers** with `docker-compose up -d --build`
   * Wait until **Keycloak** is fully loaded
1. In any REST Client (e.g. Postman) use GET method and visit `http://localhost:8762/public`
   * Expected message **Hello World, Public!**
1. In any REST Client (e.g. Postman) use GET method and visit `http://localhost:8762/secured`
   * Authorization -> Type -> OAuth 2.0
   * Token Name: **Token**
   * Grant Type: **Authorization Code (With PKCE)
   * Callback URL: **http://localhost:8762**
   * Auth URL: **http://keycloak:8080/realms/helloworld-realm/protocol/openid-connect/auth**
   * Access Token URL: **http://keycloak:8080/realms/helloworld-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token**
   * Client ID: **helloworld-client**
   * Code Challenge Method: **SHA-256**
   * Click **Get New Access Token -> Use Token**
   * Click **Send**
   * Expected message **Hello World, Secured!**
1. Clean up environment 
     * In a command line tool **remove Docker containers** with `docker-compose down --rmi all`
     * Stop **Docker** tool
     * Remove new line from **hosts**

##### Optional steps:
1. In a command line tool validate Docker Compose with `docker-compose config`
1. In a command line tool check list of Docker images with `docker images`
1. In a command line tool check list of all Docker containers with `docker ps -a`
1. In a command line tool check list of active Docker containers with `docker ps`
1. In a command line tool check list of Docker nerworks with `docker network ls`
1. In a command line tool check Service container logs with `docker logs service-container`


USAGE KUBERNETES (KIND)
---------------------------

> **Usage Kubernetes** means that all services are started as Kubernetes pods. 

> Please **clone/download** project, open **project's main folder** in your favorite **command line tool** and then **proceed with steps below**.

> **Prerequisites**:
